# UHF_Lite_Pico_Expansion_Software

The frequency range of the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) Lite Expansion, a radio frequency device, is 300 MHz to 3 GHz. Wireless communication systems, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, Wi-Fi networks, and other short-range wireless communication applications, frequently employ UHF modules. UHF modules are created to send and receive signals over brief distances, usually up to a few hundred metres, and they have benefits like fast data transmission rates, low power consumption, and inexpensive price. Moreover, Anteena is on board.
