# UHF_Lite_Pico_Expansion_Software

The frequency range of the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) Lite Expansion, a radio frequency device, is 300 MHz to 3 GHz. Wireless communication systems, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, Wi-Fi networks, and other short-range wireless communication applications, frequently employ UHF modules. UHF modules are created to send and receive signals over brief distances, usually up to a few hundred metres, and they have benefits like fast data transmission rates, low power consumption, and inexpensive price. Moreover, Anteena is on board.

2. Install MicroPython in Raspberry pi PICO
     first you need to press the boot button then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new device named         "RPI-RP2" drag this file "firmware.uf2" to this device as shown in figure
